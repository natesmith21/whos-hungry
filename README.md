<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project was started as my final Capstone project in a Full-Stack Software Developent Certification I worked on through Springboard. 

Currently the App has several simple features: 

* View Recipes from the Spoonacular API
* Create a User Account to save recipes 
* Browse Recipes by cuisine-type 

I would love to continue to work on this project in my spare time. You will see in my DB schema files, that I have already created fields in DB to enact some further features to allow users to rate and track if they have made recipies. Other future features I'd like to build include: 

* Connect users as 'friends' 
* Allow user uploads 
* more robust browse/filter/sort features
* Comments on recipes
* I am curious if I could use regex to help me work with the information coming from API and improve some UI
