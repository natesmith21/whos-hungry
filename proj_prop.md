# Project Proposal 

| ------ | ------|
|Stack Focus | I'm going to user Node, React, and postgresql for this app. | 
|Type | It will be a website | 
|Goal | A place for users to find, collect, and recollect on recipes | 
|User Demographic | People who like to cook at home | 
|Data |  I am going to utilize the Spoonacular.com food API's for my recipes. I will collect basic user demo information to create users profiles. Users save recipes to thier profile. Maybe users will be allowed to upload their own recipes as well? |

The API has a lot of features, which seem to include it's own user base and such. I feel like I can make the user info on my own (and potentially some other items) and save the API calls + get the experience of building a few more pieces on my own. 


The free version only allows for 150 **POINTS** a day, it seems not all calls are equal points, but I hope this is not an issue while I'm building it, I think I should be able to work around it. If it were ever to be a 'full blown' webiste for people to use it would obviously need a different api connection.
